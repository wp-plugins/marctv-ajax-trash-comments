Grants visitors the ability to report inappropriate comments and admins to replace and trash them in the frontend.

== Description == 

Adds a link next to the reply link below each comment, which allows visitors to flag comments as inappropriate.
A sub page to comments in admin is added, where an administrator may review all the flagged comments and decide
if they should be removed or not.

Admins or logged-in users with comment moderation permissions are able trash or replace comments with
one click in the frontend. This action can not be undone. A "trash" link will appear bellow all comments.
Don't worry: You can untrash them if until you reload. You are also able to replace the comment text with a custom
text which can be set in the settings.
