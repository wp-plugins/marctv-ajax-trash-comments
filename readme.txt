Grants visitors the ability to report inappropriate comments. Admins are able to replace and trash comments in the frontend.

== Description == 

Adds a link next to the reply link below each comment, which allows visitors to flag comments as inappropriate.
A sub page to comments in admin is added, where an administrator may review all the flagged comments and decide
if they should be removed or not.

Allow admins to trash or replace comments with your custom moderation text in one click in the frontend.

You need to be logged in as admin or any user with comment moderation permissions. A "trash" link will appear beneath
all comments in the frontend. Now you can mark comments as "trash" and they will disappear after a page reload.
Don't worry: You can "untrash" them if it was a mistake until you reload.

You are also able to replace the comment text with a custom text which can be set in the settings.
This action can not be undone.
